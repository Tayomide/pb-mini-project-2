# Scope of work
Lets keep a standard size for boxes of 300 pixels for now, we can change later if we need.
Users are able to enter some information into different fields defined below and this information will be displayed on those boxes. 

## Task 1
Entry fields where 1 user is able to enter the information they would like to display on the box.
Price: User will enter (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)
Property Type: User will enter  (only ALPHABETS ALLOWED)
Year Built: User will enter  (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)
Beds: User will enter  (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)
Baths: User will enter  (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)
Sq Ft: User will enter  (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)
Property Address:  User will enter  (NUMBERS AND ALPHABETS ALLOWED)
Description:  User will enter  (only ALPHABETS ALLOWED)
Price/per Sq Ft: User will enter  (only NUMBERS ALLOWED)

## Task 2
We will have 5 boxes for this task. Those 5 boxes should display fields 1 to 5 ONLY (from task 1) on the main page.
Once they select 2 or more (like you guys did when they select 2 or more, they can click on compare and those boxes pop-up),
they can click on compare and on the pop-up screen, they can see ALL THE FIELDS (from 1 to 9) side-by-side.

## Task 3
On the left side of checkbox (on each box), add an icon (such as a star icon), so when a user click on that star icon,
the icon will convert into Yellow color, and particularly that box will be added into a new HTML page which will be called "Favorites".
